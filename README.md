# sentence_similarity_nlp_project

The Python scripts contain all the functions to compute similarity. We implemented the paper

*Y. Li, D. McLean, Z. A. Bandar, K. Crockett, et al., “Sentence similarity based on semantic nets
and corpus statistics,” IEEE Transactions on Knowledge & Data Engineering, no. 8, pp. 1138–1150,

Evaluated the performance of the algorithm on the Quora dataset available on kaggle. The problem is to identify duplicate questions and we do that using lexical similarity, word order similarity and semantic similarity metrics.

The ipython notebook contains the analysis we performed on Quora dataset.
